# Qwadro Acceleration Frameworks
The **Qwadro Acceleartion Frameworks** (**AFX**) is the standard implementation of the Qwadro API specification, ISO C17 open standard, low-level data-oriented, federated execution ecosystem that offers a set of acceleration building blocks to edify system softwares targeting computer simulations and multimedia user experiences. It is essentially a set of software infrastructures whose middlewares, libraries, drivers and engines developed on the Qwadro relies on. AFX is released as open source under the Qwadro License.

The **SIGMA FEDERATION** and all members shall not be held liable to any person or entity for any reason related to the adoption or implementation of, nor adherence to the recommendations in, nor any other use of this project nor any accompanying software.

The codebase was written for compilation in LLVM/Clang. No other toolset was tested except MSVC (and worked when so), which is not officially supported because it has never been a real C compiler. Qwadro also doesn't use CMake because the main developer had problems (and laziness) with Visual Studio 2017, the main IDE used to code the Qwadro since 2017/01/01.

Qwadro was firstly designed for POSIX/Unix/Linux systems. Due to complexities handling multiple OpenGL contexts in Windows, we were forced to move to Windows and stay there still now. Game-related works featured in Qwadro are strongely inspired in notorious engineering works on Bang! Engine by Ensemble Studios and MaxFX by Remedy Entertainment.

There are several strange names in Qwadro, because Qwadro is an experiment that implements several paradigms of the same concept with random names to test both in parallel, and its API changes frequently depending on usage optimization. And... it is governed by methodist laws of Go Horse.
There is some RenderWare semantics heritage still present. For example, we have afxRaster, afxQuat, afxV3d, afxV4d.

## Qwadro Video Graphics Infrastructure
The **Qwadro Video Graphics Infrastructure** (**VGI**) is the foundation of the Draw I/O System that was developed to encapsulates some of the low-level tasks that encompasses functionality for device discovery, solicitation and enumeration, swap-chain creation, and presentation that are needed by device driver interfaces (DDI) and implementations to the Draw I/O System. VGI provides a common framework for future graphics components. It also defines a DDI that manages low-level shared tasks independently from the drawing mechanism runtime. The tasks implemented with VGI will be handled by the VGI DDI.

## The Qwadro Sound Synthesis Infrastructure
The **Qwadro Sound Synthesis Infrastructure** (**SSI**) is the foundation of the Sound I/O System that was developed to encompasses functionality for device discovery, solicitation and enumeration, as well as equipments and technologies that support the creation, processing, distribution, and playback of audio content generated by sound synthesis that are needed by device driver interfaces (DDI) and implementations to the Sound I/O System. It also defines a DDI that manages low-level shared tasks independently from the drawing mechanism runtime. The tasks implemented with SSI will be handled by the SSI DDI.

## Qwadro Multimedia UX Infrastructure
The **Qwadro Multimedia UX Infrastructure** (**MMUX**) is the foundation of the User I/O System that was developed to enhance usability and the user experience in multimedia user interfaces (MMUIs) with shell environments. MMUX manages how windows are opened, closed, resized, and arranged on the screen, contributing to a smooth and organized workflow. It offers options for users to customize themes, layouts, and toolbars to suit their preferences, enhancing personal usability and facilitating user interactions, making complex tasks easier to perform through intuitive designs.

## The Qwadro Simulation Infrastructure
The **Qwadro Simulation Infrastructure** (**QSI**) is the foundation of the Qwadro Simulation that was developed to encompasses functionality for device enumeration, solicitation and enumeration, and that provide the necessary basic tools and resources for running complex simulations efficiently.
